## Features

- Utilizes PyTorch framework for building and training the deep learning model.
- Incorporates preprocessed datasets, available for download from the following sources:
    - [CIC-InvesAndMal2019](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/invesandmal2019.html)
    - [CCCS-CIC-AndMal-2020](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/andmal2020.html)
    - [CIC-AndMal2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/andmal2017.html)
- Includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

<!--# Model Versioning

The trained deep learning model will be versioned using Git. You can track the model's development and changes over time by leveraging Git's version control capabilities. The repository will include tags or branches to represent different versions of the model.

To access a specific model version, use the following command:
